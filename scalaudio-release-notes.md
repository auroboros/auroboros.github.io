### 0.1.0 (2016-12-23)
This is considered to be the first somewhat stable release (converging on some basic patterns). A lot is left unimplemented but the core is pretty usable and the pending implementations will be released as PATCH releases (0.1.x) until a new "stability milestone" is reached.

Highlights:

* relies on signal-z for flow paradigms
* many immutable versions of processors implemented, few mutable implemented
* analyzers not great
* MIDI mono/polysynth still around from earlier versions but not heavily tested, could use an update (parser diverged from JSyn?)
* examples of basic synths, envelopes
